Possible procedure for new VG files
===================================
Generate skip files
* pnames.pl for missing player names
* qskips.pl for missing qx entries
* (TODO: Something with play vs. cards)

Fix rest semi-manually
* Look at ./reader -D and the .sht files
* Then run normally with -c etc.


converge (lives in src for now):
-----
perl converge.pl 07

runs on all files in 007000, makes a zfix07.txt file with proposed
fixes and a zrest07.txt file which is not as useful.

hinter:
-----
perl hinter.pl cvg07.txt

extracts proposed fixes from cvg??.txt into a zref??.txt file.
Will often fail, as it doesn't like several error types.
The zref file has to be edited manually in generl.

shorts:
-----
perl shorts.pl cvg07.txt

extracts short files from a zref??.txt file and causes them to
be skipped.

tofix:
-----
perl tofix.pl zref07.txt

parses a zfix??.txt file and applies the fixes to central ref files.



adder:
-----
addref can add a line to an existing (or new) ref file.
Can be require'd by other scripts.

qxer:
-----
Can fix (directly) qx BBO bugs of the form:
qx|o1,BOARD1|
(at least I think it's bug).

tricker:
-----
Can fix (directly) mc|dd| for qx entries where all 13 tricks are played.

commatizer:
-----
Can fix too many or too few commas at the end of an rs line.
(But may be wrong when the last contract does not have 4 characters?).

rser:
-----
Can fix bug where a line break is inserted into normal text when
that text ends on rs| (which looks like a BBO tag).

multicom:
-----
Can delete multi-line nt comments.

sorter:
-----
Can sort a file by qx (o1, c1, o2, c2, ...), delete the ref file
and make an orig file.



miss:
-----
This was an early script to find card mistakes.  hinter is 
somewhat better.
