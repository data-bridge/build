* 16002 o4 DBL detected? 17392 o11 too.  314 c15
* TD, director.  Also check new RS_REPLACE tag for clues.
* Find unrealistic sequences (opening final contract)
* Very expensive bids (offering huge upside score).
* out-of-order --> .noval for 8055,6,7,8,9, 60,1,2,3,4, 6

Tags
* Make a ROTATE tag in validateLIN
* Move to -1 syntax where counts are large

* Another str() function that outputs an IMP sheet,
  will also need vul

* clean up refstats.pl

Dates (NER)
* Detect conflicts between own extractions and HTML from Japan.
  Also extract directly from BBO
* Extract dates with perl from .lin files (mn and vg)

Tourneys (NER)

Player names (NER)

C++ code
* rewrite validateLIN with a function and a loop
* rewrite Segment TODO with functions
* do something about dispatch.cpp; make chunk a struct with methods?
* Print example of each validate "error"
* Still segfault at end?
* Allow concatenated files, e.g. RBN but also LIN
* TODOs

Perl
* Clean up perl path and @INC

Quality of fixes
* No duplicates in BBOSH (file names)
* BBOSH files sorted properly into directories
* Screenscrape major championships, compare.
* Check links (http, www).  Also from deleted nt comments.
* Look again at players once we check the links in lin files.
* Store convention cards?

Data
- Include BBOVG and BBOSH up to today
- Look for more sources?  Later...

update Pavlicek missive and Excel

Regression
----------
* ./reader -I -R -c -s -v 30 (maybe -p as well)
* ./reader -I -D -v 30
* perl refstats.pl all
* perl scripts/flagref.pl 019000 (ref file quality)
* perl checkskip.pl all, perl checkref.pl all

Stats
-----
19,306,468 in LIN_VG
    25,440 in .ref

- Number of (good) hands
- Number of files
  - Perfect
  - Some fixes (say few .ref lines and few .xxx effect lines)
  - Skips

Functionality

-A analyse DD
-p play analyze DD
-n output all names to appropriately named text files

Makefiles

Valuation
---------
Board: Valuation

Double-dummy
------------
* Tableau: Call DDS
* Trace: 
  - (1) old trace, can count mistakes
  - (2) new trace, can compare within suit and between suits,
    probably friend of Deal.  Need new DDS function?

How to multi-thread the DDS calls?
Threads consume single boards from segments (all instances).

Database
--------
Be able to store
- Play trace, including error types
- Hand to open bidding (0-4)
- board display number, can check dealer/vul then
- Files, Dirs (or combine?)
- Systems, and some characteristics
 Defenses, and some characteristics

Generate each of the tables in an sqlite DB as txt

Ingest them into sqlite in a separate program

some kind of "make" ("scour") looks for new or changed files.
Output proposed deltas to DB

Find a way to normalize all important text fields.

Should somehow recognize complete duplicates.
Remember to skip hands with no auction or with no players.


Syntax for .bsf files
---------------------
(Bridge script files)
player alias "Display,Last,First" "Display"
select segment "segment"
unselect segment
postpone (rerun in the end, e.g. for partner counts)
select board 7
(stuff to do with the selected board, e.g. contract)
Actually, make it sql-like
