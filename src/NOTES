Split output files into tmp/LIN, tmp/EML etc.
Should not be possible that LIN->LIN generates session errors.
Check the output matrix for general consistency.

Why does writing take so long -- file system or += string?

When multi-threading, exceptions still go to stdout?
Maybe put errors to cerr.

Print examples of each problem (small or large).

Add == comparison (read written file back into, compare groups as ==)

Remove LIN_EXT

Functionality
-------------
JEC PBN
- support ##
LIN VG
- Include alerts in RBN
- Parse headers for semantic content
LIN shein
LIN tourneys
Test on concatenated RBN file

Checks
------
Check that there is never > 1 segment in RP files.
Make Board checks.
Should somehow recognize complete duplicates.

options
-------
-b "binary compare", write to temp file, read back in, check ==
-S stats on lengths (incl cards per play etc.)
-N name file
-A analyse DD
-p play analyze DD

Code quality
------------
Tools
- cppclean
- doxygen including dot
- include-what-you-use
- clang static analyzer

Add g++ makefile for Ubuntu
Try the g++ trick to get unused methods
Update makefiles (file lists)

Valuation
---------
Board: Valuation

Double-dummy
------------
* Tableau: Call DDS
* Trace: 
  - (1) old trace, can count mistakes
  - (2) new trace, can compare within suit and between suits,
    probably friend of Deal.  Need new DDS function?

How to multi-thread the DDS calls?
Threads consume single boards from segments (all instances).

Database
--------
Be able to store
- Play trace, including error types
- Hand to open bidding (0-4)
- board display number, can check dealer/vul then
- Files, Dirs (or combine?)
- Systems, and some characteristics
- Defenses, and some characteristics

Generate each of the tables in an sqlite DB as txt

Ingest them into sqlite in a separate program

some kind of "make" ("scour") looks for new or changed files.
Output proposed deltas to DB

Syntax for .bsf files
---------------------
(Bridge script files)
player alias "Display,Last,First" "Display"
select segment "segment"
unselect segment
postpone (rerun in the end, e.g. for partner counts)
select board 7
(stuff to do with the selected board, e.g. contract)
Actually, make it sql-like
