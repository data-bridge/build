LIN_VG:
* 29123 works
* 34567
  - line numbers are off (1306-1765)
  - 2DW+2 contradicts later mc 9.
    Consider whether both result are still reachable.
    Also DD in position.
* 34999
  - o12 alert goes onto wrong bid (1NT, not P)

validate:
* Print example for each "error"

update Pavlicek missive and Excel

Functionality
-------------
JEC PBN
- support ##
- Find way to ignore OptimumResult
LIN VG
- Include alerts in RBN
- Parse headers for semantic content
LIN shein
LIN tourneys

LIN as it is now, and modified Buffer

Test on concatenated RBN file

Add ability to store optimal results from PBN.

options
-------
-A analyse DD
-p play analyze DD
-n output all names to appropriately named text files

Makefiles
---------
        compile runs    threads
-------------------------------
visual  yes     yes     yes
cygwin  yes     segf
mingw   almost
clang
ubuntu

Valuation
---------
Board: Valuation

Double-dummy
------------
* Tableau: Call DDS
* Trace: 
  - (1) old trace, can count mistakes
  - (2) new trace, can compare within suit and between suits,
    probably friend of Deal.  Need new DDS function?

How to multi-thread the DDS calls?
Threads consume single boards from segments (all instances).

Database
--------
Be able to store
- Play trace, including error types
- Hand to open bidding (0-4)
- board display number, can check dealer/vul then
- Files, Dirs (or combine?)
- Systems, and some characteristics
- Defenses, and some characteristics

Generate each of the tables in an sqlite DB as txt

Ingest them into sqlite in a separate program

some kind of "make" ("scour") looks for new or changed files.
Output proposed deltas to DB

Find a way to normalize all important text fields.

Should somehow recognize complete duplicates.

Syntax for .bsf files
---------------------
(Bridge script files)
player alias "Display,Last,First" "Display"
select segment "segment"
unselect segment
postpone (rerun in the end, e.g. for partner counts)
select board 7
(stuff to do with the selected board, e.g. contract)
Actually, make it sql-like
