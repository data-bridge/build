----------
Sheet
* 16002 o4 DBL detected? 17392 o11 too.  314 c15
* Another str() function that outputs an IMP sheet, will also need vul
* Get rid of heurfix in favor of Sheet?
  Good outputs (try deleting a ref file), CHOOSE (line1) (line2)

C++ code
* rewrite validateLIN with a function and a loop
* Make a ROTATE tag in validateLIN
* do something about dispatch.cpp; make chunk a struct with methods?
* Go through once for cleanup (TODO)
* Allow concatenated files, e.g. RBN but also LIN

Data
- Include BBOVG and BBOSH up to today
- Look for more sources?  Later...

Perl scripts in BBOVG
- Make director.pl run without warnings 
  (so have log files of acceptable deviations)

NERs
* Dates: Write extractor for embedded dates in tags
* Tourneys
* Player names

Higher semantics
* No duplicates in BBOSH (file names)
* Find unrealistic sequences (opening final contract) [valuation]
* Very expensive bids (offering huge upside score).
* Check links (http, www).  Also from deleted nt comments.
* Look again at players once we check the links in lin files.
* Store convention cards?
* Screenscrape major championships, compare.

update Pavlicek missive and Excel

Regression
----------
* ./reader -I -R -c -s -v 30 (maybe -p as well)
* ./reader -I -D -v 30
* perl refstats.pl all
* perl skipnames.pl all (make it generate skip files)
* perl skiphands.pl all (make it generate skip files)
* perl director.pl dir (a lot, unfortunately)
* perl checkskip.pl all, perl checkref.pl all


Makefiles
---------
        compile runs    threads
-------------------------------
visual  yes     yes     yes
cygwin  yes     segf
mingw   almost
clang
ubuntu

Valuation
---------
Board: Valuation

Double-dummy
------------
* Tableau: Call DDS
* Trace: 
  - (1) old trace, can count mistakes
  - (2) new trace, can compare within suit and between suits,
    probably friend of Deal.  Need new DDS function?

How to multi-thread the DDS calls?
Threads consume single boards from segments (all instances).

Database
--------
Be able to store
- Play trace, including error types
- Hand to open bidding (0-4)
- board display number, can check dealer/vul then
- Files, Dirs (or combine?)
- Systems, and some characteristics
 Defenses, and some characteristics

Generate each of the tables in an sqlite DB as txt

Ingest them into sqlite in a separate program

some kind of "make" ("scour") looks for new or changed files.
Output proposed deltas to DB

Find a way to normalize all important text fields.

Should somehow recognize complete duplicates.
Remember to skip hands with no auction or with no players.


Syntax for .bsf files
---------------------
(Bridge script files)
player alias "Display,Last,First" "Display"
select segment "segment"
unselect segment
postpone (rerun in the end, e.g. for partner counts)
select board 7
(stuff to do with the selected board, e.g. contract)
Actually, make it sql-like
