Look at iterators: (1) auto, (2) it-> instead of new lookup?

Tableau: Call DDS
Trace: (1) old trace, can count mistakes
(2) new trace, can compare within suit and between suits,
probably friend of Deal.  Need new DDS function?

How to multi-thread the DDS calls?
Threads consume single boards from segments (all instances).


databases:
- names
- input filename -> number, so can make uid for each hand.
  Maybe also store segment names here
- hands

some kind of "make" ("scour") looks for new or changed files.
Could possibly delete old hands and update them, ditto input file.
(names would remain, I think.)

Should somehow recognize complete duplicates

Extend to all Pavlicek's formats?
- DAT: Very basic text format
- DUP: Half binary, probably makes sense to do
- EML: Another txt-like format
- PPL: Sparse binary format -- do?
- RBX: Easy variation on RBN
- REC: Yet another txt-like format
- TXT: Maybe use his instead of mine
- HTM: Don't do


Make stats (histogram) of #cards given per play

Reconcile modified lin files (and pbn and rbn?) with original ones.
Companion .fix files?

Order
-----
Write BBO parser for regular LIN files incl. JEC files
Same for Vugraph files
Write RBN parser to Pavlicek's files
Set up hands directory structure of some sort


Thoughts on PlayerDB
--------------------
struct consisting of
UID (not in struct?)
BBO handle
Country
Display name
Last name (several entries permitted)
First name (several entries permitted)

Use MySQL names, kind of?
Lookup(UID)
UID = FindExact(BBO, Display, Last then first name)
UID list = FindApprox(quality of fit), maybe Select
UID = Add(struct?)
bool Merge(UID1, UID2)
bool Delete(UID)
Renumber()
ReadFile(file), set lock
WriteFile(same or other file)
Release lock
Set(UID, struct or field + field name)

Print(by UID, BBO, Display, Last name then first name)

Syntax for .bsf files
---------------------
(Bridge script files)
player alias "Display,Last,First" "Display"
select segment "segment"
unselect segment
postpone (rerun in the end, e.g. for partner counts)
select board 7
(stuff to do with the selected board, e.g. contract)
