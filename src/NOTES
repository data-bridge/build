----------
New scripts
* director.pl
  regex for td, director (lc)
  note qx sequence in lin file and hands with this content
  from ref file if any, note hands skipped due to director
  attempt to match up, count when it succeeds
  when it doesn't, propose lines for
  - current hand
  - previous hand in same room
  - hand in other room
  to determine manually
  also note contract in header vs qx? and RS_REPLACE tag for hand

Sheet
* 16002 o4 DBL detected? 17392 o11 too.  314 c15
* Another str() function that outputs an IMP sheet, will also need vul

C++ code
* rewrite validateLIN with a function and a loop
* Make a ROTATE tag in validateLIN
* rewrite Segment TODO with functions
* do something about dispatch.cpp; make chunk a struct with methods?
* Print example of each validate "error"
* Still segfault at end?
* Allow concatenated files, e.g. RBN but also LIN
* TODOs
* Go through once for cleanup

Perl
* Clean up perl path and @INC
* Move scripts around, only keep the keepers

Data
- Include BBOVG and BBOSH up to today
- Look for more sources?  Later...


NERs
* Dates: Write extractor for embedded dates in tags
* Tourneys
* Player names

Higher semantics
* No duplicates in BBOSH (file names)
* Find unrealistic sequences (opening final contract) [valuation]
* Very expensive bids (offering huge upside score).
* Check links (http, www).  Also from deleted nt comments.
* Look again at players once we check the links in lin files.
* Store convention cards?
* Screenscrape major championships, compare.

update Pavlicek missive and Excel

Regression
----------
* ./reader -I -R -c -s -v 30 (maybe -p as well)
* ./reader -I -D -v 30
* perl refstats.pl all
* perl scripts/flagref.pl 019000 (ref file quality)
* perl checkskip.pl all, perl checkref.pl all


Makefiles
---------
        compile runs    threads
-------------------------------
visual  yes     yes     yes
cygwin  yes     segf
mingw   almost
clang
ubuntu

Valuation
---------
Board: Valuation

Double-dummy
------------
* Tableau: Call DDS
* Trace: 
  - (1) old trace, can count mistakes
  - (2) new trace, can compare within suit and between suits,
    probably friend of Deal.  Need new DDS function?

How to multi-thread the DDS calls?
Threads consume single boards from segments (all instances).

Database
--------
Be able to store
- Play trace, including error types
- Hand to open bidding (0-4)
- board display number, can check dealer/vul then
- Files, Dirs (or combine?)
- Systems, and some characteristics
 Defenses, and some characteristics

Generate each of the tables in an sqlite DB as txt

Ingest them into sqlite in a separate program

some kind of "make" ("scour") looks for new or changed files.
Output proposed deltas to DB

Find a way to normalize all important text fields.

Should somehow recognize complete duplicates.
Remember to skip hands with no auction or with no players.


Syntax for .bsf files
---------------------
(Bridge script files)
player alias "Display,Last,First" "Display"
select segment "segment"
unselect segment
postpone (rerun in the end, e.g. for partner counts)
select board 7
(stuff to do with the selected board, e.g. contract)
Actually, make it sql-like
