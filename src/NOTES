Double dummy
- Do Trace as well (needs o1, c1, ...)
- Multiple segments: Data structure needs list of pointers, not pointer,
  for file results

RefLines
- Parsing an insert file.lin
  - Has * Buffer, initially nullptr
  - When first line requires it, is new'ed and read
  - When going out of scope, is given up (delete'd)
- Keep filename for comparison (only one allowed for now)
- RefLines gets insertion() similar to deletion()
- Buffer::fix
  - [What is line 422 doing?  "Deleted a field"?]
  - INSERT: modify() into a vector<string> of size insertion
  - Loop over and make LineData to classify and insert
  - REPLACE and external reference (need function to tell: isExternal())
    - More than one line removed?
    - More than one line added?

44913: Already uses new format, so doesn't work

40985: Already has a c1, but shorter than in c1
- Need replace (of interval of lines), not insert

A few .ref skips still have origs (27294)

In perl
* Get orig -> untangle done
  - Check MERGED and DUPLICATE
  - Anything left in orig directory? No MERGED, maybe DUPLICATE
  - No SUBSET any more (use MERGED)
* make a mergelin that goes from "orig" (the copy) to untangle
  directly
* compare with untangle
* Write C++ to parse new format (only permit one lin copy file)
  - Must read ../12345.lin as well
  - Count hands
  - Make statistics with proper tags

* Download all lin files again
* diff them against current ones (33464.lin should have an orig)

* Make another directory with the original lin, ref and skipref files

----------
Valuation
* Improve setCompBalanced to go by #cards and #points, not prod,
  to calculate distances

Term
* Try one vs. Valuation
* Implement Term more generally
* Think about limits that one Term imposes on other terms (big table)

dispatch
* More general language parser?
  Write dispatch language suitable also for later SQL queries
* Select by year as well?

Perl scripts in BBOVG
- Make director.pl run without warnings 
  (so have log files of acceptable deviations)

Data
- Include BBOVG and BBOSH up to today
- Look for more sources?  Later...
- Check that Sheet and SheetHand still work

NERs
* Dates: Write extractor for embedded dates in tags
* Tourneys
* Player names

Higher semantics
* Find unrealistic sequences (opening final contract) [valuation]
* Very expensive bids (offering huge upside score).
* Check links (http, www).  Also from deleted nt comments.
* Look again at players once we check the links in lin files.
* Store convention cards?
* Screenscrape major championships, compare.

update Pavlicek missive and Excel

Regression
----------
* perl skipnames.pl all (make it generate skip files)
* perl skiphands.pl all (make it generate skip files)
* ./reader -I -R -c -s -q -v 30 (maybe -p as well, -e)
  - with -e, use mergelin.pl for some merges (first without fix
    as third argument, then with it).  Manual edits of lin files
    may be better sometimes.
    Can run on whole bridgedata/hands directory, at least -e
* ./reader -I -D -v 30
* perl director.pl dir (a lot, unfortunately)
* perl checkskip.pl all, perl checkref.pl all


Makefiles
---------
        compile runs    threads

Valuation
---------
Board: Valuation

Double-dummy
------------
* Trace: 
  - (1) old trace, can count mistakes
  - (2) new trace, can compare within suit and between suits,
    probably friend of Deal.  Need new DDS function?

How to multi-thread the DDS calls?
Threads consume single boards from segments (all instances).

Database
--------
Be able to store
- Play trace, including error types
- Hand to open bidding (0-4)
- board display number, can check dealer/vul then
- Files, Dirs (or combine?)
- Systems, and some characteristics
 Defenses, and some characteristics

Generate each of the tables in an sqlite DB as txt

Ingest them into sqlite in a separate program

some kind of "make" ("scour") looks for new or changed files.
Output proposed deltas to DB

Find a way to normalize all important text fields.

Should somehow recognize complete duplicates.
Remember to skip hands with no auction or with no players.


Syntax for .bsf files
---------------------
(Bridge script files)
player alias "Display,Last,First" "Display"
select segment "segment"
unselect segment
postpone (rerun in the end, e.g. for partner counts)
select board 7
(stuff to do with the selected board, e.g. contract)
Actually, make it sql-like
