----------
Need exceptions to go into sheet str somehow, not end up
in general output.

- 30020 addPlay (Card D2 not held)
- 30165 addCall (Call after auction is over)
- 30334 nextLIN (Bad LIN line)
- 30699 setRBN (Malformed RBN team line)
- 30706 addPlay (Invalid card)

-30849: Why DD difference in equality test?

Do doubled contracts get detected in Sheet (always, sometimes,
never)?  E.g. 30502.sht o24

30637 c2: Why shown as "Claim 8"?

ref line modification:
- Expand referr.cpp: classify function

Run on a lot of VG files.

Sheet:
- Another str() function that outputs an IMP sheet,
  will also need vul
- Can be extended to the "rotated" plays in early VG files
- Deal can report #recurring hands out of (up to) 4 cards
- See whether a hand is completely messed up, or only a few
  cards, or only rotations

At some point we need to explain the skips as well;
that can go in the skip file.

Complete replacements should go in ref file,
* replace
followed by the new file


Statistics on sources
- Number of (good) hands
- Number of files
  - Perfect
  - Some fixes (say few .ref lines and few .xxx effect lines)
  - Skips

Quality of fixes
- No skip or ref file without a data file (lin to start with)
- No skip file with a ref file
- No duplicates in BBOSH (file names)
- BBOSH files sorted properly into directories
- Detect complete skips
- Fixes in order
- Screenscrape major championships, compare.
- Check links (http, www).


Number of lines:
19,306,468 in LIN_VG
    25,440 in .ref


LIN_VG files with multiple players
- Could be multiple segments
- Could be running changes
- Tolerate whole files or deleted parts of files as well
- Normal play files (6939.lin).

Too harsh fixes especially in BBOVG
- Try multi-threading of BBOVG and also BBOSH
- Fixes should only be for real file errors; program should
  tolerate more
- Fixes might have a fourth entry with the type of fix
- May have deleted whole hands due to single bad cards...
- Maybe tolerate tricks in wrong order within each trick

Too lenient
- No "real" players (West,North,East,South)
- Very expensive bids (offering huge upside score).
- Very expensive or "stupid" plays (quickTricks?).
- Find unrealistic sequences (opening final contract)
- 37865.lin, c32: Why is 2NT, W and 1NT, W not flagged apart?
  (Also perhaps doubled or not?)

Code
- Print example of each validate "error"
- No % comment except LIN_RP and perhaps PBN
- Make prettier line break in LIN print except LIN_RP.
- Buffer should pick up .ref automatically.
- Still segfault at end?
- Allow concatenated files, e.g. RBN but also LIN
- TODOs

Data
- Include BBOVG and BBOSH up to the end of 2016
- Look for more sources?  Later...

update Pavlicek missive and Excel


Functionality
-------------
Named Entity Recognizers for
- Player names
- Tournaments

options
-------
-A analyse DD
-p play analyze DD
-n output all names to appropriately named text files

Makefiles
---------
        compile runs    threads
-------------------------------
visual  yes     yes     yes
cygwin  yes     segf
mingw   almost
clang
ubuntu

Valuation
---------
Board: Valuation

Double-dummy
------------
* Tableau: Call DDS
* Trace: 
  - (1) old trace, can count mistakes
  - (2) new trace, can compare within suit and between suits,
    probably friend of Deal.  Need new DDS function?

How to multi-thread the DDS calls?
Threads consume single boards from segments (all instances).

Database
--------
Be able to store
- Play trace, including error types
- Hand to open bidding (0-4)
- board display number, can check dealer/vul then
- Files, Dirs (or combine?)
- Systems, and some characteristics
- Defenses, and some characteristics

Generate each of the tables in an sqlite DB as txt

Ingest them into sqlite in a separate program

some kind of "make" ("scour") looks for new or changed files.
Output proposed deltas to DB

Find a way to normalize all important text fields.

Should somehow recognize complete duplicates.

Syntax for .bsf files
---------------------
(Bridge script files)
player alias "Display,Last,First" "Display"
select segment "segment"
unselect segment
postpone (rerun in the end, e.g. for partner counts)
select board 7
(stuff to do with the selected board, e.g. contract)
Actually, make it sql-like
